What key information do you extract?\nThe patient reports two primary symptoms occurring concurrently:\na) Severe, acute pain localized to the head, described using an impact metaphor (\"hitting my head very hard\").\nb) A sensation of postural instability or impending collapse (\"falling down\").\n\n#### 2. What patterns or signals do you detect?\nThe co-occurrence of severe cephalic pain and a sensation of unsteadiness or dizziness (potential presyncope or vertigo) is a critical signal. The language emphasizes the *intensity* of the pain (severe/very hard) and the *immediacy* of the instability.\n\n#### 3. What is your confidence level?\n**Confidence Level: High (90%)** in translating the reported *sensations* (pain and instability).\n**Confidence Level: Moderate (65%)** in precisely classifying the type of instability (i.e., differentiating between true vertigo, lightheadedness, or presyncope) without further patient input.\n\n#### 4. What are potential uncertainties?\na) **Nature of Instability:** Does \"falling down\" refer to true rotational vertigo (spinning), lightheadedness (dizziness/giddiness), or presyncope (feeling faint)?\nb) **Quality of Pain:** Is the pain sharp, throbbing, crushing, or dull? The \"hitting\" metaphor suggests acute impact, but the underlying pain quality needs clarification.\nc) **Duration and Onset:** The narrative does not specify the duration or suddenness of these symptoms.\n\n---\n\n## Final Analysis\n\n| Metaphorical Expression | Clinical Concept Mapping | Neutral Clinical Translation |",

What key information do you extract?\n*   **Symptom 1 (Headache Quality):** Severe, sudden-onset headache described as an impact (\"someone is hitting my head very hard\"). This is a critical indicator of potential acute intracranial pathology (e.g., thunderclap headache).\n*   **Symptom 2 (Associated Symptom):** Acute instability, dizziness, or presyncope (\"feel like falling down\"). This suggests acute functional impairment and potential neurological or systemic instability.\n\n#### 2. What patterns or signals do you detect?\n*   **High-Risk Headache Pattern:** The description of the headache suggests a potential \"thunderclap\" onset, which is a classic red flag for life-threatening conditions such as Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH), cerebral venous thrombosis, or acute hypertensive crisis.\n*   **Acute Neurological Compromise:** The combination of severe headache and acute instability/ataxia signals potential acute central nervous system involvement (e.g., stroke, cerebellar pathology).\n*   **Acute Distress:** The severity of the symptoms indicates acute distress and functional impairment.\n\n#### 3. What is your confidence level?\n**Confidence Level: High (9/10)**\n*   *Reasoning:* The patient's description uses language that strongly implies acute, severe, and potentially catastrophic onset, regardless of underlying cause.
