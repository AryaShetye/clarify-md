What patterns or signals do you detect?\nThe metaphor \"being hammered\" is a common patient descriptor used to convey **pulsatile** or **throbbing** pain.

The core concepts extracted are **distance, separation, vastness, and uncertainty regarding magnitude.**\n\n2.  **What patterns or signals do you detect?**\n    The signal is the use of an astronomical analogy to describe a perceived gap or barrier. This pattern suggests the patient is externalizing an internal feeling of **isolation, unreachability, or a significant perceived distance** between their current state and a desired state (or between themselves and support/recovery). The interrogative nature (\"How far is...\") signals a desire to quantify or understand the magnitude of this perceived barrier.\n\n3.  **What is your confidence level?**\n    **Confidence Level: Moderate.**\n    (High confidence that the theme is separation/distance; Moderate confidence regarding the specific clinical referent due to lack of context.)\n\n4.  **What are potential uncertainties?**\n    The primary uncertainty is whether the question is literal or figurative.

              "emotion": "## Emotional Biomarker Agent Analysis\n\n### Reasoning\n\n**1. What key information do you extract?**\nThe patient asks a specific, factual question: \"How far is moon from earth.\" This is an inquiry about general knowledge and spatial orientation.\n\n**2. What patterns or signals do you detect?**\nIn a clinical setting, a question of this nature, especially if unsolicited or repeated, functions as a strong **Cognitive Impairment Signal**. The pattern detected is a potential deficit in orientation, reality testing, or concentration. While the linguistic structure is neutral, the content strongly suggests **Confusion** or **Disorientation**.\n\n**3. What is your confidence level?**\n**Confidence Level: Moderate-High (0.75).** The signal is clear, but the context is absent. We are highly confident that this statement necessitates a follow-up cognitive assessment (e.g., orientation to time, place, and situation).\n\n**4. What are potential uncertainties?**\nThe primary uncertainty is the **context and intent**. The question could be:\na) A sign of acute delirium/altered mental status.\nb) A sign of chronic cognitive decline (dementia).\nc) A benign attempt at distraction or small talk (low probability in a high-acuity setting).\nd) A direct response to a cognitive assessment question administered by staff.\n\n---\n\n### Final Analysis\n\n| Emotional State Detected | Clinical Terminology Mapping | Intensity (0.0-1.0) | Clinical Significance Flag |\n| :----------------------- | :--------------------------- | :-------------------- | :------------------------- |\n| Confusion/Disorientation | Cognitive Impairment Signal  | 0.7                   | **ATTENTION REQUIRED**     |\n\n**Narrative Interpretation:**\nThe patient's statement is not emotionally charged in its delivery but is highly significant due to its content. It serves as an indicator of potential **Altered Sensorium** or a deficit in **Orientation to Reality",
              "risk": "## Risk & Red-Flag Agent Analysis\n\n### Reasoning\n\n#### 1. What key information do you extract?\nThe extracted information is a general knowledge question: \"How far is moon from earth.\"\n*   **Symptom Data:** None.\n*   **Chief Complaint:** None.\n*   **Patient Status:** Unknown.\n\n#### 2. What patterns or signals do you detect?\n*   **Signal:** The narrative is entirely non-medical and non-physiological.\n*   **Pattern Detection:** No pattern of illness, pain, or distress is present.\n*   **Urgent Indicator Check:** No indicators of acute distress, severe pain, trauma, or life-threatening symptoms are detected.\n*   **Potential Risk (Contextual):** If this statement were made by a patient in a clinical setting who was expected to provide symptoms, it would be a significant red flag for **Altered Mental Status (AMS), confusion, delirium, or severe communication barrier.** However, based purely on the text provided in isolation, this risk cannot be confirmed.\n\n#### 3. What is your confidence level?\n**Confidence Level: 100%** (Confident that the text contains zero clinical data.)\n\n#### 4. What are potential uncertainties?\n*   **Context:** Is this text truly a patient narrative, or is it a test of the system?\n*   **Patient Status:** If this is a patient, why are they asking a non-medical question? (This relates back to the AMS/confusion risk, which cannot be assessed without context.)\n\n---\n\n### Final Analysis\n\n| Assessment Category | Finding |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Clinical Urgency** | **Low** |\n| **Red Flags/Urgent Indicators** | None detected based on physical symptoms. |\n| **Missing Information** | Chief complaint, symptoms, patient context, duration of illness, and any indication of distress. |\n| **Confidence Level for Risk Assessment** | High (100% confident that the text lacks clinical data.) |\n\n**Reasoning Summary:**\nThe provided narrative is a factual question about astronomy and contains absolutely no clinical data, symptoms, or indicators of physical distress. Therefore, the clinical urgency is assessed as Low. The primary risk identified is the **lack of any medical information**, which prevents a meaningful clinical assessment. If this statement originated from an individual seeking medical help, the immediate red flag would shift to **Altered Mental Status or severe cognitive impairment.**",

Patient Voice & Presentation\n\n| Category | Finding |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Patient Utterance (Direct Quote)** | \"How far is moon from earth\" |\n| **Observed Affect** | Neutral. No clinically significant emotional distress or acute affective change was identified concurrent with the utterance. |\n| **Contextual Relevance** | The utterance is an inquiry regarding astronomical distance, noted by the analysis agents as contextually irrelevant to a typical clinical discussion. |\n\n### II. Clinical Interpretation & Synthesis\n\nThe patient presented with a single, factual inquiry unrelated to immediate physical or emotional state.\n\n**Metaphor and Thought Process:** The utterance is interpreted as a literal question, raising the possibility of a **non-sequitur** or **tangentiality** in the formal thought process. The content of the inquiry is external and non-personal. Due to the lack of surrounding clinical dialogue, the intent of the utterance (e.g., distraction, genuine curiosity, or manifestation of a thought disorder) remains indeterminate.\n\n**Emotion and Affect:** Analysis indicated an absence of significant emotional distress or affective signals associated with the statement.\n\n### III. Risk Assessment & Safety Profile\n\n**Risk Level:** Low.\n\n**Rationale:** The narrative content contains no indicators of acute illness, injury, pain, suicidal ideation, homicidal ideation, or immediate clinical urgency. The risk assessment is based solely on the content provided, which is a general knowledge question.\n\n### IV. Uncertainties & Information Gaps\n\n**Confidence Level in Interpretation:** Low.\n\nThe"
